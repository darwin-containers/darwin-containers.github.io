# Darwin Containers

Containers have fundamentally changed the way that modern software is developed and deployed. Containers are supported by a wide range of operating systems including FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux and even Windows, but are not natively supported by Darwin. **Until now.**

We're announcing initial 0.0.1 release of Darwin native containers.  Yes, you can now **run Darwin inside Darwin**, build images using Docker and distribute them using registries.

Installation is available via [Homebrew](https://github.com/darwin-containers/homebrew-formula#readme).
