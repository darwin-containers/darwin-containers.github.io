# macOS Containers

Containers have fundamentally changed the way that modern software is developed and deployed. Containers are supported by a wide range of operating systems including FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux and even Windows, but are not natively supported by macOS. **Until now.**

We're announcing initial release of macOS native containers.  Yes, you can now **run macOS inside macOS**, build images using Docker and distribute them using registries.

So what are you waiting for? Installation is available via [Homebrew](https://github.com/macOScontainers/homebrew-formula#installation).
